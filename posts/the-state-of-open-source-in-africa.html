                <h2>The Open Source Africa Festival 2020</h2>
<p> 

At the beginning of this year, I had the privilege of being invited to be a keynote speaker at the inaugural Open Source Festival Africa. This was my third time travelling to Nigeria, just a few months earlier I had been in Abuja for the annual PyCon Nigeria conference, and was happy to be headed back! The festival was held in Lagos State and hosted over 800 OSS enthusiasts from around the continent and the world. It was incredibly fun to meet attendees from such diverse backgrounds, from OSS designers to university students starting to learn how to code, to experienced PHP devs (yes, those still exist! Sorry that‚Äôs an unnecessary dig at PHP.) For me, it was particularly exciting to meet many Python developers at the conference too! Many of whom, I‚Äôd met a few months earlier at Pycon Nigeria. The PSF sponsored both conferences, so it was fun to have a constant stream of familiar faces pass by the booth to say hi! I was also joined at the PSF booth by <a href="https://twitter.com/mawy_7" target='_blank'>Mannie Young</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kafui4k" target='_blank'>Kafui Alordo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zuoike" target='_blank'>Chukwudi</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KelvinOyanna"target='_blank'>Kelvin Oyanna</a> from the Ghanaian and Nigerian Python communities.</p>

<p>The conference was packed from start to finish with fantastic talks! Some highlights for me included a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper" target='_blank'>Prosper Otemuyiwa</a>, an Open Source veteran on the continent who shared about his own journey contributing to OSS.  Prosper is such a gifted speaker, and his talk gave the audience practical advice on how to grow their skills and gain confidence. I‚Äôd highly recommend looking out for it whenever it‚Äôs uploaded on the festivals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr12SA6qoKe-mWgsGd09sYQ" target='_blank'>Youtube channel</a>. </p>

<p>Another highlight was a talk given by <a href="https://twitter.com/amcasari" target='_blank'>Amanda Casari</a>, an engineering manager on the Google Open Source team. Amanda gave a talk entitled ‚ÄòData Science Hearts Open Source.‚Äô Her talk examined the ecosystems of data science and how sometimes the systems we aim to create are not the systems which emerge in reality. She gave some poignant examples of this and explained how open source communities can contribute to equitable representation and inclusive NLP. I got to spend some time with Amanda throughout the conference and really saw her walk her talk by being genuinely open and interested in everyone she met! </p>

<p>To be honest, I could go through every talk I saw and share how it impacted me, but that would make this post too long. Again, I‚Äôd encourage you to check out the OSCA festival <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr12SA6qoKe-mWgsGd09sYQ" target='_blank'>Youtube channel</a> and watch the talks once they‚Äôve been uploaded. I do want to make a special mention of my fellow keynote speakers, <a href="https://twitter.com/EriolDoesDesign">Eriol Fox</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenrwalli">Stephan Walli</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coderinheels">Gen Ashley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aniediudo"> Aniedi Udo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/moyheen">Moyinoluwa</a>, all brilliant speakers and leaders of note on their respective fields. Another special mention goes to the OSCA team, the conference was meticulously planned, the design was stunning and uniquely African and the community was so warm and welcoming! I appreciate the organisers so much for all their hard work! You can have a look at some of the work they're doing <a href="https://www.oscafrica.org/">here</a>. </p>

                <h2>A Broader Perspective </h2> 

<p>Let‚Äôs change pace a bit and take a broad view perspective on the current state of Open Source in Africa. There are 3 key things I‚Äôd like to discuss; demographics, distribution and direction (I‚Äôm sorry, but whenever I can alliterate, I will alliterate!)
<br>
<br>
<b>Demographics</b>
    <br>
    <br>
When discussing the technology community in Africa several things need to be considered. The world wide web was created in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet" target='_blank'>1989 by Tim Berners-Lee</a>, an English scientist who wanted to create a system to share information through a network of computers. 11 years after this in the year 2000, almost half of the US population had access to information through the internet. At the same time 99% of people in Sub-Saharan Africa were still offline. 15 years later in 2016 78% of North America was online, 73% of Europe and only 20% of Sub-Saharan Africa was online. Have a look at this handy graph created by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet" target='_blank'>ourworldindata.org</a> (which is where I'm pulling most of these statistics from.)
</p>

<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet" target='_blank'><img src="../img/internet-use.png" width="600" style="align-content: center;"></a>

<p>
Before I continue, I want to make a note here. Africa is a LARGE continent. For North-America 78% of their population in 2016 was 279 million people, 20% of Sub-Saharan Africa in 2016 was 206 million people. This is really important to keep in mind!<br><br>
Another thing to be concious of is that although, African countries came online at a much slower pace than their global counterparts, countries like Ghana and Malawi doubled the number of users using the internet in just the past 3 years. Today there are <b><a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/last-month-over-half-billion-africans-accessed-internet" target='_blank'>525 million internet users in Africa</a>, almost double the number of internet users in North America</b>.  
    <br>
    <br>
So what are the ramifications of all of this? The data shows us that the general population in Africa began to access the internet primarily in 2001, almost a decade after the rest of the world. There are exceptions, for example South Africa is home to some of the largest and oldest technology companies in the world, but we know that at the time those industries were created South Africa was still under an apartheid regime and therefore resorces like the internet were predominantly available only to White elites. Technology evolves at such a rapid pace that this late adoption has had a strong impact on how many Africans have been able to enter and succeed in the tech space.  
<br>
<br>
At the OSCA festival, attendee‚Äôs consisted primarily of people within their 20s and 30s, and primarily of junior level devs. Although I don‚Äôt know the exact figures, I would propose that the African developer community is made mainly of students, recent graduates and junior developers. This has been the case for PyCon Africa and other developer communities I‚Äôve been part of locally in Zimbabwe. This also means that our technology industry is fairly young and that compared to other continents, we have fewer experienced developers. You can certainly find some, but they are harder to come by. 
<br>
<br>
This demographic characteristic also translates into our OSS project ecosystem. At the moment, you‚Äôd be hardpressed to find an OSS project originating from Africa that‚Äôs more than 10 years old. 
<br>
<br>
    
I'll pause briefly here to say that youth is not necessarily always a bad thing. Prominent global OSS projects for example Drupal are under 20 years old. 
<br>
<br>
However, for many young developers on the continent that want to consider pioneering projects, there are many barries. In a Zimbabwean tech Slack channel that I joined recently, someone brought up the idea of starting a local OSS project. Many people people in the group complained that open source is only for the privileged. One person spoke about how you need to afford childcare and freetime to even start thinking about contributing. In the current economic climate in Zimbabwe, many developers are focused on making money just to survive. To be honest, in the case of Zimbabwe, I would have to agree. If there was a way that we could actively support African OSS developers financially, I think we'd see a spike in participation. Lets leave this train of thought here for now and move on to the next point.   

<br>
<br>
<b>Distribution</b>
<br>
    <br>
On my way to the festival, I left Harare at 7:20 am and arrived in Lagos almost 13 hours later! To get to Lagos, there were no direct flights. I had to pass through Johannesburg, South Africa and Accra, Ghana. This was also the shortest flight that I could find and it cost approximately USD$700. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Super pumped to finally be on my way to Lagos for <a href="https://twitter.com/oscafrica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target='_blank'>@oscafrica</a> üíï‚ú® Looking forward to meeting everyone and being back in beautiful Nigeria üá≥üá¨ <a href="https://t.co/Qk8hvLequM">pic.twitter.com/Qk8hvLequM</a></p>&mdash; Marlene Mhangami (@marlene_zw) <a href="https://twitter.com/marlene_zw/status/1230425130339328000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Something you‚Äôll hear almost consistently when talking about travel within Africa is that its expensive! The cost for me to fly into Lagos is about the same for me flying to London. I also needed to apply for a visa and paid USD$150 for one. Of course, the argument is that Africa is a large continent,  but I often think to myself that so is Europe, and in-Europe, travel is very reasonable. What comes to mind at that point are limitations the continent currently has in terms of infrastructure, which is another topic for another day.  <br>
    <br>

All of this to say that it‚Äôs not easy for me to travel to another African country on a whim. In many ways, I think this makes collaboration between countries challenging. As I mentioned earlier we have a very high number of people on the continent using the internet, however the people that do have access to a <b>reliably strong connection</b>, and have the means to contribute to OSS are widely dispersed. At the Open Source Africa festival, I found a number of great open source projects, including this list of projects <a href="https://github.com/acekyd/made-in-nigeria" target='_blank'>made in Nigeria</a>. However, I did not find many, if any at all, projects being collaborated on by people from across the continent. This is something that should make us increasingly unsettled, especially as we become more and more connected. 
<br>
    <br>
<b>Direction</b>
<br>
    <br>
    So now that we've looked at some of the challenges of OSS on the continent, what does the future of open source in Africa look like? Where are headed? Well, first of all, I think that in the next few years if the right resources and support are provided we are going to start to see the African technology industry become more mature. Those junior devs are going to turn into intermediate and senior level devs, and those startups are going to become established businesses. So far we‚Äôve seen Africans contributing significantly to OSS projects based outside the continent. For example, in a talk that he gave at <a href="https://twitter.com/pyconafrica" target='_blank'>Pycon Africa</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Moustapha_6C" target='_blank'>Moustapha Cisse</a>, the head of Google AI‚Äôs research lab in Ghana, mentioned that Africans contribute immensly to the Tensorflow ecosystem. According to Github, in their 2019 <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" target='_blank'>State of the Otoverse Report</a>, Africa is breeding more developers than anywhere else in the world (read <a href="https://weetracker.com/2019/11/07/africa-fastest-growing-continent-for-developers/" target='_blank'>this article</a> for a breakdown.
<br>
<br>
My prediction is that this growth will continue, and along with it, we'll start to see an increase in the creation of pan-African projects from within the continent and regular contributions to those projects. 
<br>
<br>
I‚Äôd also like to think that the amount of hiring of talent from Africa will go up. At the moment, many large tech companies have research, product and marketing offices on the continent, but few have engineering offices that are more than just a handful of people. 
<br>
Last year, Andela, a company that focuses on connecting talented African developers to work remotely for companies abroad, laid off more than 400 of its developers. To many Africans, this came as a huge disappointment, but Andela did have an explanation for its decision. According to CEO Jeremy Johnson, their target market is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/africa-focused-andela-cuts-400-staff-as-it-confirms-50m-in-revenue/" target='_blank'>not looking for junior talent</a>, but intermediate to senior level developers instead.
Although this is a pretty bitter pill to swallow, if it‚Äôs true, this problem can be solved by creating a system that provides the numerous junior developers around Africa with relevant experience.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For anyone reading this, who‚Äôs interested in open source in Africa, I‚Äôd like to leave you with a few ideas on how you can contribute to the future being created here. First of all, if you are a developer or a technology entrepreneur, <b>starting creating!</b> Now more than ever, we need you to create! I will always argue that the urge to create is a human urge, a natural compulsion. Without African people taking bold steps to make projects that address their needs, the future we hope for will not manifest. <br>
    <br>
If you are a part of a business or organisation, I'd ask you to start thinking about how you can <b>support</b> the pan-African developer community. Whether that‚Äôs providing resources, advocating for hiring from the continent or offering mentorship, there are so many ways you can step into this future with us! 
<br>
    <br>
This post is primarily focused on defining where we are more clearly. I‚Äôll be sharing another post soon about some practical steps we can all take, and some steps I‚Äôm taking to see the growth of the pan-African open source community.
